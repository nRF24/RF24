"""
A simple example of sending data from as many as 6 nRF24L01 transceivers to
1 receiving transceiver. This technique is trademarked by
Nordic Semiconductors as "MultiCeiver".

This example was written to be used on up to 6 devices acting as TX nodes &
only 1 device acting as the RX node (that's a maximum of 7 devices).
