# Linux Installation

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD031 -->
Generic Linux devices are supported via SPIDEV, MRAA, RPi native via BCM2835, or using LittleWire.

@note The SPIDEV option should work with most Linux systems supporting spi userspace device.

@warning These install instructions are beginning to age because they were designed with the assumption that
the arm-linux-gnueabihf-g\*\* compilers were available and default for the system. If you have problems
using the manual install instructions (especially on a 64-bit OS), please try the
[instructions using CMake](md_docs_using_cmake.html).

@note Since wiringPi is no longer maintained or distributed (as of RPi OS 11 bullseye),
pigpio is now required for using the radio's IRQ pin. This applies to RPi, SPIDEV, and pigpio drivers. The MRAA driver may provide its own IRQ implementation. Remember that the RPi OS lite variant does not ship with pigpio installed.

## Automated Install

**Designed & Tested on RPi** - Defaults to SPIDEV on devices supporting it

1. Install prerequisites if there are any (pigpio, MRAA, LittleWire libraries, setup SPI device etc)
2. Download the install.sh file from [http://tmrh20.github.io/RF24Installer/RPi/install.sh](http://tmrh20.github.io/RF24Installer/RPi/install.sh)
   ```shell
   wget http://tmrh20.github.io/RF24Installer/RPi/install.sh
   ```
3. Make it executable
   ```shell
   chmod +x install.sh
   ```
4. Run it and choose your options
   ```shell
   ./install.sh
   ```
5. Run an example from one of the libraries
   ```shell
   cd rf24libs/RF24/examples_linux
   ```
   Edit the gettingstarted example, to set your pin configuration
   ```shell
   nano gettingstarted.cpp
   make
   sudo ./gettingstarted
   ```

## Manual Install

1. Install prerequisites if there are any (pigpio, MRAA, LittleWire libraries, setup SPI device etc)
   @note See the [MRAA](http://iotdk.intel.com/docs/master/mraa/index.html) documentation for more info on installing MRAA
2. Make a directory to contain the RF24 and possibly RF24Network lib and enter it
   ```shell
   mkdir ~/rf24libs
   cd ~/rf24libs
   ```
3. Clone the RF24 repo
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/tmrh20/RF24.git RF24
   ```
4. Change to the new RF24 directory
   ```shell
   cd RF24
   ```
5. Configure build environment using
   ```shell
   ./configure
   ```
   script. It auto detectes device and build environment.

   For overriding autodetections, use command-line switches, see
   ```shell
   ./configure --help
   ```
   for description.
6. Build the library, and run an example file
   ```shell
   make
   sudo make install
   ```
   ```shell
   cd examples_linux
   ```
   Edit the gettingstarted example, to set your pin configuration
   ```shell
   ano gettingstarted.cpp
   make
   sudo ./gettingstarted
   ```

### Build using SPIDEV

1. Make sure that spi device support is enabled and /dev/spidev\<a\>.\<b\> is present
2. Manual Install using SPIDEV:
   ```shell
   ./configure --driver=SPIDEV
   make
   sudo make install
   ```
3. See the gettingstarted example for an example of pin configuration
