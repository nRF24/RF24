# Using CMake

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD031 -->
A more modern approach instead of using hand-crafted _Makefiles_ & _configure_ scripts
to build & install software. Please note that these instructions are not needed if you
have already installed the library using [these older instructions](md_docs_linux_install.html)

## Installing the library

You can install the library in a few different ways.

- Building and installing the library from source code is preferable since it will include all the latest changes.
- Installing the library (via a package manager) from a pre-built package is mostly for cross-compiling purposes, but it can be useful for environments that don't have all the build-time dependencies (namely CMake).

@warning If you have previously installed the library from source code using the
[the older instructions](md_docs_linux_install.html), then you will need to
uninstall it manually to avoid runtime conflicts.
```shell
sudo rm /usr/local/lib/librf24.*
sudo rm /usr/local/lib/librf24-bcm.so
sudo rm -r /usr/local/include/RF24
```

The _librf24-bcm.so_ file may not exist if you used CMake to install the library.

@note Since wiringPi is no longer maintained or distributed (as of RPi OS 11 bullseye),
pigpio is now required for using the radio's IRQ pin. This applies to RPi, SPIDEV, and pigpio drivers. The MRAA driver may provide its own IRQ implementation. Remember that the RPi OS lite variant does not ship with pigpio installed.

### Automatic Installation

There is a newer automatic install script that makes use of the CMake approach.

1. Download the install.sh file from [https://github.com/nRF24/.github/blob/main/installer/install.sh](https://github.com/nRF24/.github/blob/main/installer/install.sh)
   ```shell
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nRF24/.github/main/installer/install.sh
   ```
2. Make it executable
   ```shell
   chmod +x install.sh
   ```
3. Run it and choose your options
   ```shell
   ./install.sh
   ```
   The script will detect needed dependencies and install what it needs according to the user input.

   It will also ask to install a python package named [pyRF24](https://github.com/nRF24/pyRF24).
   This is not the same as the traditionally provided python wrappers as the pyRF24 package can be
   used independent of the C++ installed libraries. For more information on this newer python
   package, please check out [the pyRF24 documentation](https://nrf24.github.io/pyRF24/).
   Note, the pyRF24 API is more pythonic instead of a direct port of the C++ API (eg. snake casing
   instead of camel casing).
4. Try an example from one of the libraries
   ```shell
   cd ~/rf24libs/RF24/examples_linux
   ```

   Edit the gettingstarted example, to set your pin configuration
   ```shell
   nano gettingstarted.cpp
   ```

   Build the examples. Remember to set the `RF24_DRIVER` option according to the one that was
   selected during the scripted install.
   ```shell
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake .. -D RF24_DRIVER=SPIDEV
   make
   ```

   Run the example
   ```shell
   sudo ./gettingstarted
   ```

### Building from source code

1. Install prerequisites if there are any (pigpio, wiringPi, MRAA, LittleWire libraries, setup SPI device etc)

   CMake may need to be installed
   ```shell
   sudo apt-get install cmake
   ```
   @note See the [MRAA documentation](http://iotdk.intel.com/docs/master/mraa/index.html) for more information on installing MRAA
2. Make a directory to contain the RF24 library and possibly other RF24\* libraries and enter it
   ```shell
   mkdir ~/rf24libs
   cd ~/rf24libs
   ```
3. Clone the [RF24 repo](https://github.com/nRF24/RF24) and navigate to it
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/nRF24/RF24.git RF24
   cd RF24
   ```
4. Create a build directory inside the RF24 directory and navigate to it.
   ```shell
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```
5. Configure build environment

   @note When using these instructions to install RF24Mesh, RF24Network, or RF24Gateway,
   the following `RF24_DRIVER` option is only needed for the RF24 library and
   examples as well as the examples for RF24Network, RF24Mesh, and RF24Gateway. The `RF24_DRIVER`
   option is not needed when installing the libraries for RF24Network, RF24Mesh, and RF24Gateway.

   Instead of specifying the `RF24_DRIVER` option in the CLI, it is recommended to use a environment
   variable named `RF24_DRIVER`.

   ```shell
   export RF24_DRIVER=SPIDEV
   ```

   These instructions assume you have not set an environment variable.

   ```shell
   cmake .. -D RF24_DRIVER=SPIDEV
   ```
   Instead of using `SPIDEV` driver (recommended), you can also specify the `RPi`, `wiringPi`,
   `MRAA`, or `LittleWire` as alternative drivers.

   If the `RF24_DRIVER` option is not specified (and it is not set as an environment variable), then
   it will be automatically configured based on the detected CPU or installed libraries (which
   defaults to `SPIDEV` when auto-detection fails).
6. Build and install the library
   ```shell
   make
   sudo make install
   ```
7. Build the examples

   Navigate to the _examples_linux_ directory
   ```shell
   cd ../examples_linux
   ```
   Make sure the pins used in the examples match the pins you used to connect the radio module
   ```shell
   nano gettingstarted.cpp
   ```
   and edit the pin numbers as directed in the [linux/RPi general documation](md_docs_rpi_general.html).
   Create a build directory in the examples_linux directory and navigate to it.
   ```shell
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```
   Now you are ready to build the examples.
   ```shell
   cmake ..
   make
   ```
   If using the `MRAA` or `wiringPi` drivers, then you may need to specify the `RF24_DRIVER`
   option again.
   ```shell
   cmake .. -D RF24_DRIVER=wiringPi
   make
   ```

   Remember that the `RF24_DRIVER` option is needed for the RF24Network, RF24Mesh, and RF24Gateway
   examples if you specified that option (via CLI or environment variable) when installing the
   RF24 library and examples.
8. Run an example file
   ```shell
   sudo ./gettingstarted
   ```

### Using a package manager

The RF24 library now (as of v1.4.1) has pre-built packages (.deb or .rpm files) that
can be installed on a Raspberry Pi. These packages can be found on the library's
[GitHub release page](https://GitHub.com/nRF24/RF24/releases)

1. Download the appropriate package for your machine

   Go to the library's [GitHub release page](https://GitHub.com/nRF24/RF24/releases), and look for
   the latest release's assets.

   For all Raspberry Pi variants using the Raspberry Pi OS (aka Raspbian), you need the file marked
   for _armhf_ architecture.

   For Raspberry Pi variants using a 64-bit OS (like Ubuntu), you need the file marked for
   _arm64_ architecture.

   Notice that the filenames will include the name of the utility driver that the package was built with.
   This does not mean that the LittleWire, MRAA, or wiringPi libraries are included in the package (you will still
   need to install those yourself beforehand).
2. Install the downloaded pkg

   If you downloaded the file directly from your target machine using the desktop environment, then
   you only need to double-click the package (deb or rpm) file, and the OS should do the rest.

   If you downloaded the file remotely and want to copy it over ssh, then use the `scp` command in a terminal.
   ```shell
   scp pkg_filename.deb pi@host_name:~/Downloads
   ```
   @note You do not need to do this from within an ssh session. Also, you can use the target machine's IP
   address instead of its host name.

   The `scp` command will ask you for a password belonging to the user's name on the remote machine (we used
   `pi` in the above example).

   Now you can open up a ssh session and install the copied package from the terminal.
   ```shell
   ssh pi@host_name
   cd Downloads
   dpkg -i pkg_filename.deb
   ```

## Cross-compiling the library

The RF24 library comes with some pre-made toolchain files (located in the
_RF24/cmake/toolchains_ directory) to use in CMake. To use these toolchain files,
additional command line options are needed when configuring CMake to build the library
(step 5 in the above instructions to build from source).

```shell
cmake .. -D CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/toolchains/armhf.cmake
make
```

If you plan on using the cross-compiled library with your personal cross-compiled
project, then it is advised to specify the path that your project will look in when
linking to the RF24 library:

```shell
cmake .. -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/arm-linux-gnueabihf -D CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/toolchains/armhf.cmake
make
sudo make install
```

Remember to also specify the `RF24_DRIVER` option (via CLI or environment variable) if
not using the auto-configuration feature (see step 5 in the above instructions to build
from source).

### Installing the library remotely

To install remotely, you can create an installable package file using CMake's built-in
program called CPack.

```shell
cmake .. -D CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/toolchains/armhf.cmake
make
cpack
```

This will create a deb file and a rpm file in a new sub-directory called "pkgs" within
the build directory. You can use either of these packages to install the library to
your target machine (see the above instructions about using a package manager).
