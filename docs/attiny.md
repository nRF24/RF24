# ATTiny

ATTiny support for this library relys on the SpenceKonde ATTinyCore. Be sure to have added this core to the Arduino Boards Manager with [this install guide](http://highlowtech.org/?p=1695)

See the included rf24ping85 example for pin info and usage

@warning The ATTiny2313 is unsupported due to lack of sufficient memory resources

Some versions of Arduino IDE may require a patch to allow use of the full program space on ATTiny. See [this resource](https://github.com/TCWORLD/ATTinyCore/tree/master/PCREL%20Patch%20for%20GCC) for the ATTiny patch.

ATTiny board support initially added from [jscrane/RF24](https://github.com/jscrane/RF24)

### ATtiny25/45/85 Pin map with CE_PIN 3 and CSN_PIN 3 - PB3 and PB4 are free to use for application

- Circuit idea from [NerdRalph's 3 pin solution](http://nerdralph.blogspot.ca/2014/01/nrf24l01-control-with-3-attiny85-pins.html)
- Original RC combination was 1K/100nF. 22K/10nF combination worked better.
- For best settletime delay value in RF24::csn() the timingSearch3pin.ino sketch can be used.
- This configuration is enabled when CE_PIN and CSN_PIN are equal, e.g. both 3
- Because CE is always high the power consumption is higher than for 5 pins solution
