# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded by
# double-quotes, unless you are using Doxywizard) that should identify the
# project for which the documentation is generated. This name is used in the
# title of most generated pages and in a few other places.
# The default value is: My Project.

PROJECT_NAME           = "Optimized high speed nRF24L01+ driver class documentation"

# Using the PROJECT_BRIEF tag one can provide an optional one line description
# for a project that appears at the top of each page and should give viewer a
# quick idea about the purpose of the project. Keep the description short.

PROJECT_BRIEF          = "TMRh20 2020 - Optimized fork of the nRF24L01+ driver"

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) path
# into which the generated documentation will be written. If a relative path is
# entered, it will be relative to the location where doxygen was started. If
# left blank the current directory will be used.

OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = ./

# The STRIP_FROM_PATH tag can be used to strip a user-defined part of the path.
# Stripping is only done if one of the specified strings matches the left-hand part
# of the path. The tag can be used to show relative paths in the file list.
# If left blank the directory from which doxygen is run is used as the path to strip.
# Note that you can specify absolute paths here, but also relative paths, which will
# be relative from the directory where doxygen is started.
#
# This tag requires that the tag FULL_PATH_NAMES is set to YES.

# Doxygen selects the parser to use depending on the extension of the files it
# parses. With this tag you can assign which parser to use for a given
# extension. Doxygen has a built-in mapping, but you can override or extend it
# using this tag. The format is ext=language, where ext is a file extension, and
# language is one of the parsers supported by doxygen: IDL, Java, JavaScript,
# Csharp (C#), C, C++, D, PHP, md (Markdown), Objective-C, Python, Slice, VHDL,
# Fortran (fixed format Fortran: FortranFixed, free formatted Fortran:
# FortranFree, unknown formatted Fortran: Fortran. In the later case the parser
# tries to guess whether the code is fixed or free formatted code, this is the
# default for Fortran type files). For instance to make doxygen treat .inc files
# as Fortran files (default is PHP), and .f files as C (default is Fortran),
# use: inc=Fortran f=C.
#
# Note: For files without extension you can use no_extension as a placeholder.
#
# Note that for custom extensions you also need to set FILE_PATTERNS otherwise
# the files are not read by doxygen.

# If the EXTRACT_ALL tag is set to YES, doxygen will assume all entities in
# documentation are documented, even if no documentation was available. Private
# class members and static file members will be hidden unless the
# EXTRACT_PRIVATE respectively EXTRACT_STATIC tags are set to YES.
# Note: This will also disable the warnings about undocumented members that are
# normally produced when WARNINGS is set to YES.
# The default value is: NO.

EXTRACT_ALL            = YES

# If the EXTRACT_STATIC tag is set to YES, all static members of a file will be
# included in the documentation.
# The default value is: NO.

EXTRACT_STATIC         = YES

# If the CASE_SENSE_NAMES tag is set to NO then doxygen will only generate file
# names in lower-case letters. If set to YES, upper-case letters are also
# allowed. This is useful if you have classes or files whose names only differ
# in case and if your file system supports case sensitive file names. Windows
# (including Cygwin) ands Mac users are advised to set this option to NO.
# The default value is: system dependent.

CASE_SENSE_NAMES       = YES

# If the SORT_MEMBER_DOCS tag is set to YES then doxygen will sort the
# (detailed) documentation of file and class members alphabetically by member
# name. If set to NO, the members will appear in declaration order.
# The default value is: YES.

SORT_MEMBER_DOCS       = NO

# If the SORT_BY_SCOPE_NAME tag is set to YES, the class list will be sorted by
# fully-qualified names, including namespaces. If set to NO, the class list will
# be sorted only by class name, not including the namespace part.
# Note: This option is not very useful if HIDE_SCOPE_NAMES is set to YES.
# Note: This option applies only to the class list, not to the alphabetical
# list.
# The default value is: NO.

SORT_BY_SCOPE_NAME     = YES

# The GENERATE_TODOLIST tag can be used to enable (YES) or disable (NO) the todo
# list. This list is created by putting \todo commands in the documentation.

# Set the SHOW_FILES tag to NO to disable the generation of the Files page. This

# documented source files. You may enter file names like myfile.cpp or
# directories like /usr/src/myproject. Separate the files or directories with

# Note that for custom extensions or not directly supported extensions you also
# need to set EXTENSION_MAPPING for the extension otherwise the files are not
# read by doxygen.

# Configuration options related to the HTML output

# created by doxygen. Using this option one can overrule certain style aspects.
# This is preferred over using HTML_STYLESHEET since it does not replace the
# standard style sheet and is therefore more robust against future updates.
# Doxygen will copy the style sheet files to the output directory.
# Note: The order of the extra style sheet files is of importance (e.g. the last

# list). For an example see the documentation.

# - LIGHT always generate light mode output
# - DARK always generate dark mode output
# - AUTO_LIGHT automatically set the mode according to the user preference,
#   use light mode if no preference is set (the default)
# - AUTO_DARK automatically set the mode according to the user preference,
#   use dark mode if no preference is set
# - TOGGLE allow to user to switch between light and dark mode via a button.
