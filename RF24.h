 * This is an example of how to do two-way communication without changing
 * transmit/receive modes.  Here, a payload is set to the transmitter within
 * the Ack packet of each transmission.  Note that the payload is set BEFORE
 * the sender's message arrives.

/**
 * @example pingpair_irq.pde
 *
 * This is an example of how to user interrupts to interact with the radio.
 * It builds on the pingpair_pl example, and uses ack payloads.
 */

/**
 * @example pingpair_sleepy.pde
 *
 * This is an example of how to use the RF24 class to create a battery-
 * efficient system.  It is just like the pingpair.pde example, but the
 * ping node powers down the radio and sleeps the MCU after every
 * ping/pong cycle.
 */

/**
 * @example scanner.pde
 *
 * Example to detect interference on the various channels available.
 * This is a good diagnostic tool to check whether you're picking a
 * good channel for your application.
 *
 * Inspired by cpixip.
 * See http://arduino.cc/forum/index.php/topic,54795.0.html

 * @mainpage Driver for nRF24L01(+) 2.4GHz Wireless Transceiver
 *
 * @section Goals Design Goals
 * 
 * This library is designed to be...
 * @li Maximally compliant with the intended operation of the chip
 * @li Easy for beginners to use
 * @li Consumed with a public interface that's similiar to other Arduino standard libraries
 *
 * @section News News
 * 
 * NOW COMPATIBLE WITH ARDUINO 1.0 - The 'master' branch and all examples work with both Arduino 1.0 and earlier versions.  
 * Please <a href="https://github.com/maniacbug/RF24/issues/new">open an issue</a> if you find any problems using it with any version of Arduino.
 *
 * NOW COMPATIBLE WITH MAPLE - RF24 has been tested with the 
 * <a href="http://leaflabs.com/store/#Maple-Native">Maple Native</a>, 
 * and should work with any Maple board.  See the pingpair_maple example.
 * Note that only the pingpair_maple example has been tested on Maple, although
 * the others can certainly be adapted.

 * This chip uses the SPI bus, plus two chip control pins.  Remember that pin 10 must still remain an output, or
 * the SPI hardware will go into 'slave' mode.
