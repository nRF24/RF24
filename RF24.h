 * @section Goals Design Goals
 *
 * This library fork is designed to be...
 * @li More compliant with the manufacturer specified operation of the chip, while allowing advanced users
 * to work outside the reccommended operation.
 * @li Utilize the capabilities of the radio to their full potential via Arduino
 * @li More reliable, responsive and feature rich
 * @li Easy for beginners to use, with well documented examples and features
 * @li Consumed with a public interface that's similiar to other Arduino standard libraries
 *
 * @section News News
 *
 * <b>April 2014: Official Release: Still some work to do, but most benefits have been realized </b><br>
 * - The library has been tweaked to allow full use of the FIFO buffers for maximum transfer speeds
 * - Changes to read() and available () functionality have increased reliability and response
 * - Extended timeout periods have been added to aid in noisy or otherwise unreliable environments
 * - Delays have been removed where possible to ensure maximum efficiency
 * - Full Due support with extended SPI functions
 * - ATTiny 24/44/84 25/45/85 now supported.
 * - Raspberry Pi now supported
 * - More! See the links below and class documentation for more info.

 *
 * Most standard Arduino based boards are supported:
 * - ATMega 328 based boards (Uno, Nano, etc)
 * - Mega Boards (1280, 2560, etc)
 * - ARM based boards (Arduino Due)  Note: Do not include printf.h or use printf begin. This functionality is already present. Must use one of the
 * 	hardware SS/CSN pins as extended SPI methods are used.
 *  Initial Due support taken from https://github.com/mcrosson/RF24/tree/due
 * - ATTiny board support added from https://github.com/jscrane/RF24
 * Note: ATTiny support is built into the library. Do not include SPI.h. <br>
 * ATTiny 85: D0(pin 5): MISO, D1(pin6) MOSI, D2(pin7) SCK, D3(pin2):CSN/SS, D4(pin3): CE <br>
 * ATTiny 84: PA6:MISO, PA5:MOSI, PA4:SCK, PA7:CSN/SS,  CE as desired <br>
