/**
  Reliably transmitting large volumes of data with a low signal or in noisy environments
  This example demonstrates data transfer functionality with the use of auto-retry
  and auto-reUse functionality enabled. This sketch demonstrates how a user can extend
  the auto-retry functionality to any chosen time period, preventing data loss and ensuring
  the consistency of data.

  This sketch demonstrates use of the writeBlocking() functionality, and extends the standard
  retry functionality of the radio. Payloads will be auto-retried until successful or the
  extended timeout period is reached.
