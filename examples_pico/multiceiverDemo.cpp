/**
 * A simple example of sending data from as many as 6 nRF24L01 transceivers to
 * 1 receiving transceiver. This technique is trademarked by
 * Nordic Semiconductors as "MultiCeiver".
 *
 * This example was written to be used on up to 6 devices acting as TX nodes &
 * only 1 device acting as the RX node (that's a maximum of 7 devices).
 * Use the Serial Terminal to change each node's behavior.
